            <p>
                We created this website as seniors at Hamilton College for our Computer Science thesis project 
                in the fall of 2024. We choose this project with the guidance of Courtney Gibbons, Professor
                of Mathematics at Hamilton College, and Darren Strash, Professor of Computer Science at 
                Hamilton College, after finding the public does not have easy access to updated information on 
                legislative actions specifically about mathematics. We aim to create easy access to 
                legislative changes related to mathematics for congressional staff and to empower citizens 
                to stay informed and engaged in the legislative process.
